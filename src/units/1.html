    <h1>Unit 1 - The Online World</h1>
    <h1>Unit Information</h1>
    <h6>How do websites work? How do emails reach your computer? How does the use of 
      computer applications affect your daily life? This unit provides an introduction to the 
      modern online world. Starting with your own experiences, you will extend your 
      knowledge of online services and investigate the technology and software that 
      supports them. You will learn more about a range of services including email, 
      online data storage, collaborative software, search engines and blogging.
      This unit will help you understand the main technologies and processes behind the 
      internet and investigate how they come together to let you view websites and send 
      information across the world. The internet and web of tomorrow will be even more 
      powerful, more connected, more intuitive and a more important part of our lives. 
      This will result in an internet of services, objects and infrastructure (ubiquitous 
      computing) which will radically change our lives. For example, smart appliances will 
      be able to talk to each other, clothes will monitor our health and retailers will access 
      social media to gain insight into shoppers' preferences.
      You will explore a range of digital devices, such as smart phones and digital music 
      players and consider the technology that enables these devices to share and 
      exchange information.
      This technology has created new concerns regarding security and privacy. You will 
      investigate these concerns and consider how users should behave online to safeguard 
      themselves and respect others.
      This unit is essential if you are considering a career in the IT sector. Online systems 
      and technology have become part of everyday work, so being able to understand and 
      work with this technology is relevant in many roles in the industry.</h6>
