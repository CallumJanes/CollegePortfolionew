    <h1>Unit 2 - Technology Systems</h1>
    <h1>Unit Information</h1>
    <h6>Technology systems are involved in many of the objects we use every day, from 
      a laptop computer and routers relaying internet traffic, to logging in to a social 
      networking site. This unit provides a first look at how the main building blocks of 
      technology systems work.
      You will explore the common hardware components of technology systems, such as 
      a touch screen or a printer, and the internal building blocks of a computer like the 
      processor, buses and memory. The unit also covers the purpose of networks, which 
      allow different devices within a technology system to communicate. (This topic is 
      covered in more detail in Unit 1: The Online World and Unit 11: Computer Networks.)
      No technology system is complete without the software that brings it to life. You will 
      explore different types of software. These will include the operating system (OS) that 
      supports the communication and management of resources, and utility programs that 
      provide functionality to maintain the system.
      You will also learn about the role of applications software, such as office programs, 
      graphics packages, accounting software and CAD/CAM, that supports many aspects 
      of everyday business life.</h6>
